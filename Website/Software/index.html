        <h2>Motherboard or Mainboard</h2>
        <p>
        Most computer motherboards have a degree of flexibility to which a range of processors can be installed, assuming it has the same type of processor socket.
        Motherboard flexibility and facilities are allied to the cost. The more expensive the motherboard the better it will be and the more flexibility it is likely to have. One facility that the gaming fraternity look for is the ability to “overclock” a motherboard. This means to make it perform faster than it was originally designed to do so.

    <section id="Processor_Cooling_Section">
        <h2>Processor Cooling</h2>
        <p>
        Increased speed will cause the processor or CPU to run hotter than usual so upgrading the fan or processor-cooler would be advisable. If you overclock your CPU or GPU you need very good cooling for overclocking because the more you overclock the higher the core temperatures will be. 
        Processor coolers come in all shapes, sizes and technologies. Generally speaking the type of cooler you will need will depends on whether you have an AMD or an Intel processor and how fast you want to want to run it.

    <Section id="Power_Supply_Section">
        <h2>Power Supply</h2>
        <p>
        The power supply is another one of the main parts of a computer including the hard drive and motherboard. Also called a PSU (Power Supply Unit), is the part which supplies the power to the computer. 
        Personal computers rather than laptops will be plugged into electrical outlets. 
        The computer will only need a specific amount of electricity so the power supply will pull what it needs from the outlet and convert the AC current into DC current. 
        The internal parts of a computer require low voltageregulated DC power which is converted by the power supply from the AC mains current.

    <section id="Wireless_Internet_Section">
        <h2>Wireless Internet (WIFI)</h2>
        <p>
        The other way of enabling a computer to have a internet access is through a wireless connection. 
        There are a few ways of doing this. One option to choose is to use a network card which is connected internally to the motherboard using a PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) slot. 
        One end of the network card will generally stick out the back of a computer which is where the antenna are. 
        These antenna will stick out from the back of the computer and are used to wirelessly connect to a network. 
        The other option is to use a Wi-Fi dongle to connect to a network. A Wi-Fi dongle is a small USB device which is plugged into a computer through a USB port. 
        They can come in different shapes and sizes but they are generally pretty small. A dongle will often include the use of some sort of software so that a network connection can be setup.

    <section id="Embedded_Internet_Ethernet_Section">
        <h2>Embedded Internet (Ethernet)</h2>
        <p>
        A way of getting internet without it being wireless would be via an ethernet cable. 
        This is a cable that is meant to be plugged in through the back of a wifi router. 
        This enables you to get a direct connection to the internet via your router. 
        An ethernet cable typically looks like this (as show to the picture on the right), they come in different lengths (depending on the situation) and they normally come in azure blue.

    <section id="Certral_Processing_Unit_CPU_Section">
        <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
        <p>
        The Central Processing Unit (or CPU for short) is circuitry that is located within a computer, it’s the unit that performs the most out of any component the CPU relies heavily on a chipset, which is a group of microchips located on the motherboard.

    <section id="Computer_Accessories_Section">
        <h2>Computer Accessories</h2>
        <p>
        A standard computer should have these accessories to run correctly, 
        these include: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Keyboard</li>
          <li>A Monitor</li>
          <li>A Mouse (These don't matter as much when using a laptop)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You could also use:
        </p>
        <ul>
              <li>A Printer</li>
              <li>A Scanner</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>
        A printer allows the user to move a digital file (such as a document or image) to a physical piece of paper, the printer runs by using ink cartriges. 
        These can run out so replacing them is a nessecity. However, (in most cases) the printer software will alter the user via a message or e-mail that the printer itself is running low on ink. 
        It should be noted coloured ink is more expensive then the standard black and white ink, you will also need paper. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Also the user should be noted for any other errors, an error like this may include paper jams. 
        For this you will need to open up the printer and to remove the paper manually. 
        The scanner is an input device that allows the user to move physical documents to a digital file (the opposite of a printer), unlike a printer you only have to buy the scanner and it's fine. 
        Some scanners are different, some are usb and some you have to plug in to an outlet and it's then connected via bluetooth. 
        Some printers have a scanner built on the top of the printer, however these can be expensive and impracticle for a house (due to the size of many standard printers).
